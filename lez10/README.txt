Legend of files:

Code is inside the file named "main.cpp" .

Compile codes with "make" command.

Executable is labelled with ".exe" extension
Execute with "./< name_executable >" command.

Clean all outputs files with "./clean.sh" command.

Input file is called "input.dat".

Outputs are: "*.res" and "seed.out"

Folder named "Circ" includes results for simulatons of Traveling Salesman Problem in a square (copied from main folder).

Folder named "LSN_10.2" includes results of exercise 9 with mpi libraries: the code was performed in remote (@tolab).
(Attention! No outputs during esecutions: wait 1-2 minutes!)
