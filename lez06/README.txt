Legend of files:

Code is insterted the file named "Monte_Caro_ISING_1D.cpp" .

Compile codes with "make" command.

Executable is labelled with ".exe" extension.

Execute with "./< name_executable >" command.

Clean all "output*" files with "./clean.sh" command.

Input file is called "input.dat".

Outputs are: "output*", "config.final" and "*.res".

Folders named "Metropolis" and "Gibbs" include results for simulatons using Gibbs and Metropolis sampling with h=0 and h=0.02.

Folders "Tmax" and "Tmin" include simulations of non-equilibrated systems.

All other files are used for generating ramdon numbers.
